My First Game 

Welcome to CraneDrop. The goal for the user within this game is to release the ball with timing to it hits the moving target with a specific given time set. What makes this game fun and addicting is the randomized set speeds that are shown at the start of the game and ejecting based on time so there's opportunity for a variety of challenges. Hitting the target presents a dialog box stating "You hit the target" while not hitting the target presents a dialog box stating "You missed the target" while closing the program after each attempt. The biggest challenge for me while working on this project was to work on the implementation to release the "ball" given the right set time by the user. Please try out my first game! Good Luck!
